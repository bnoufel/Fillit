# Fillit

## Validated: 100/100

Fillit does not consist of recoding Tetris, but remains a variation of the game in the mind.

Your program will take in parameter a file describing a list of Tetriminos
that he will then have to arrange them to form the smallest possible square. 

The goal is of course to find this smallest square as quickly as possible despite a number
of arrangements that grow explosively with each additional piece.
